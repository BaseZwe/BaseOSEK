1 what have been done. 
start to analyze he specification and try to abstract some general requirements for the implementation. 
The document os232.pdf is a mixture of the requirements and specifications. 
Only with clear requirements the traceability can be guaranteed. --> for test and for validation. 

--> basic concept about validation and verification. 
validation, have you construct the right product. --> against requirements
verification, has the product been rightly constructed. --> against specifications. 

They are a bunch of acceptance tests are supplied. It could only test if the requirements are fulfilled 
but without any traceability. is really every requirement covered ? With the traceability from the requirements 
to acceptance test suites and implementation the question can be answered. 

(recommanded books, requirements engineering - third edition. )

2. work needs to be done in next week 
finish with the requirements analysis. have basic picture over the whole system. 
optimize the project structure. 

3. the work needs to be done in the furture.
project: 
specification and design with EA. (traceability with requirements)

Infrastructure. 
Review Platform --> Facebook review system. 
Issue tracing and task management --> Bugzilla. (construct server myself or use server of others)
Wiki system --> github not bad, (could start up own server) . 

--zhaw.
